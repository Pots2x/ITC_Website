                Computer science can be defined as the study of algorithms and data transformations. 
                Thus, the discipline is deeply concerned with analysis, efficiency, automation, as well as development.
                A computer scientist's workload includes application, program development, and problem-solving using algorithms
                 and computers. This allows the discipline to be capable of various professions, ranging from software development 
                 and IT specialist to data scientist and hardware engineer. However, it focuses a lot more on computational theory 
                 and mathematical analysis than other computer disciplines. Due to its usefulness and variety, it has a great
                  ability to be compatible with other professions as a result of said professions making use of complex computations.
                   For example, DNA is viewed as information (like how computers are binary, DNA uses a base-4 number system), 
                   allowing biologists to work with computer scientists to develop algorithms that can construct a complete organism 
                   from bits and fragments of DNA sequences.

                    emphasizes theoretical knowledge, one would expect a computer scientist to deal with the studies of algorithms, 
                    informatics, artificial intelligence, as well as programming. They are often those who are tasked with finding or 
                    inventing new technologies using the theoretical knowledge they have obtained.

                    is mostly associated with the hardware of computers. It touches upon both Electrical engineering and Computer Science, 
                    as it includes the integration of software and hardware. They design and create your electronic devices, laptops, PCs, etc.

                    deal with computers in a business environment. They are largely responsible for the computer-based management
                     of resources and accounting. The automatic recording of transactions is the work of IS, they also are responsible
                      for working with their respective businesses or organizations to infer decisions based on collected data.

                    involves the design and development of technology to support and satisfy the needs of the user. They are mostly responsible 
                    for the production and maintenance of an organization's or business' computer infrastructure. ITs tend to be the ones handling
                     the maintenance of the technology that an organization uses.
