                    Computer hardware is the physical component that a computer is made up of. Numerous different types of hardware exist, 
                    differing in purpose, location, or size. We can categorize computer hardware in terms of location, they 
                    are the internal and external hardware. Internal hardware is described as components located within the computer or 
                    computer case, they can be categorized as processing or storage components. The most common types of internal components 
                    that are found in nearly all modern PCs are the motherboard, RAM, CPU, Graphics card (or GPU), storage (HDD or SSD), and 
                    also the cooling system (either fan or water-cooled). External hardware is defined as the hardware components that are 
                    found outside the computer case, they are also commonly referred to as "peripherals". Most external components are either 
                    input or output hardware, common input hardware are the mouse, keyboard, web camera, microphone, and even external storage. 
                    Common output hardware are your monitors, speakers, and printers.

                    Software can be defined as a set of instructions or procedures that tell the computer what tasks to perform. 
                    Both software and hardware interact with each other, simply put, the software tells hardware components what 
                    to do and how to do it. It can be categorized as system software 
                    or application software. System software is general-purpose software that handles the basic computer's basic 
                    functions. Application software is software that is designed to perform specific tasks mainly for the user.

                    Large businesses, especially those with a hierarchical structure, process and take in a 
                    large number of data and information. Thus, it is common for them to use an Information System to 
                    manage their data and make use of the information processed from it. Systems like the Transaction 
                    Processing System (TPS), Management Information System (MIS), and Executive Information System (EIS) 
                    are used by many large organizations. It is also not uncommon for 
                    schools to make use of devices that aid teachers in educating students, it could be as simple as a 
                    laptop or desktop computer to devices specifically designed for the presentation like interactive 
                    whiteboards. Much like businesses, hospitals also use a Health Information 
                    System to monitor patients or help decision-making.
