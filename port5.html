                Motherboards are essential for computer systems as they are the center of a computer's circuit. They function as 
                the connection between all the other parts of a computer, this is how every other computer part can function and 
                communicate with each other. We may consider it as the platform for all computer parts to connect to for communication. 
                How a motherboard is configured and developed if these components work together and how.

                The motherboard is made up of a few components that provide functionality and use:

                    This is usually a CPU, it is the largest chip in the motherboard. 
                    A fan may be placed near it along with a heatsink to control its temperature.

                    In the form of RAM (Random Access Memory), there would be slots where the RAM would be placed, 
                    how many and what type of socket depends on the motherboard.

                    Depending on the motherboard, the number of expansion slots would differ. These slots allow the 
                    motherboard to take in more components and add more functionality.

                    The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) chip is where the low-level programs and code are stored. 
                    This can be considered firmware and is how your computer hardware operates.

                    The CMOS chip stores important information used by the computer, such as time, date, and 
                    hardware settings. The battery prevents such information from being erased when a computer is turned off or restarted.
