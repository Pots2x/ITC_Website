                    Although often confused with each other, as both are commonly used interchangeably, data and information have 
                noticeable differences that greatly differ from each other. Simply put, data is any symbol, image, number, or 
                sound that has no meaning as they are out of context or seemingly unrelated. Information then is the refinement
                 of this data, where the data is given context to be comprehensive. Data is processed into information by a 
                 human, as humans contextualize the data with computers providing computational power. Once information is generated 
                 from data, this information is then comprehended into knowledge by the human. This knowledge is stored in the
                  human, however, this knowledge can be returned into data as it can be externalized into information and stored 
                  into a media (storage media like video, hard drive memory, print, etc.) as data.

                    Information Systems (IS) use computer processes and technological solutions in management.
                     It started in World War II and early into the 1960s when the TELEX machine allowed long-range 
                     communication between different organizational branches where IS became more and more mainstream
                      (but usually in accounting departments). One prominent work of IS is the World Wide Web itself, as 
                      it is a type of IS called the Networked Information System (NIS). The goal of IS is to connect five elements:
                       the people/users, processes, information resources, computing devices, and the communications infrastructure.

                <h2>Different Types of Support Systems in Information Systems</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="class-description">
                <p>
                    There are six Major IS types: Transaction Processing System, Knowledge Work System,
                     Office Automation System, Decision Support System, Management Information System, and 
                     Executive Support System. These can be divided into either the Operations Support 
                     System or the Managerial Support System. The Operation Support System is used by 
                     low-level managerial positions with routine decisions. These are tailored by the organization 
                     for the varied requirements of each job position as well as managerial positions.

                The <strong>Knowledge Work System</strong> is designed to allow connections with experts in order to share and record 
                their knowledge. This enables a constant update of information for the operations.

            </p>

                <strong>Office Automation System</strong> is the integration of telecommunications and technology to better the productivity 
                and efficiency of the business functions of an organization.

        <div class="paragraph-standard">
            <p>
                The <strong>Decision Support System</strong> is a knowledge-based system used by senior managers to simulate the 
                effects of their decisions, especially in situations wherein no predefined procedures are available.

            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Executive Support Systems</strong> gives top executives vital information needed for them to make strategically viable decisions. 
                It takes sources from internally and externally, utilizing data and information gathered from other systems in the organization.
