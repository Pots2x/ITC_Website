                    A very powerful computing machine that can reach up to PentaFLOPS of computational power, 
                    usually very large, and makes use of multiple computers (CPUs maybe also GPUs) to break apart tasks in a process called parallel processing.

                    Typically weaker than a supercomputer but can still process large amounts of data, they can handle numerous calculations as they 
                    also make use of parallel processing. You may think of mainframe computers being a weaker supercomputer as they are 
                    typically used in businesses or situations that handle large data without it being extremely complex. Think of mainframes 
                    being used to handle the transaction load of an entire bank or two and a supercomputer handling the complicated computations of quantum physics.

                    Minicomputers were very popular in the 20th century, though they were weaker than mainframes they still 
                    provided ample computational power for large enough datasets. Today, they are considered obsolete.

                    These are computers that are designed to be used by professionals, thus they would require high-end hardware. 
                    Though, workstations are nowhere near as powerful as mainframes or supercomputers. Workstations are often created with a 
                    specific work in mind, either CAD software or maybe something that makes use of 3D software.

                    This is usually used for everyday and personal use, thus this is the most common and commercialized type. 
                    Think of your personal computers or laptops. Though they are similar to workstations, they differ in function 
                    and purpose (which dictates their speed and power).
