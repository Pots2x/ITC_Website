            Early humans use objects or markings to record numbers, these are the positional 
            number system. In this system, there is an associated weight in each digit called a radix. 
            Mixed radix numbers are when the radix is not fixed, like how we measure time 24 hours in a day and 60 minutes in an hour.
            This means that when we have number in base 10 (with a radix 10) like 211 it is written as: 
            
            <br><br>(2 x 10^2) + (1 x 10^1) + (1 x 10^0)<br><br>
            
            In the decimal (base 10) system, there 10 possible objects from 0 to 9, similarly, binary (base 2) only has 2 from 0 to 1.

                1101 in decimal is:
            
                <br><br>(1 x 2^3) + (1 x 2^2) + (0 x 2^1) + (1 x 2^0)<br>8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13 (base 10)<br><br>

                Is in base 8 with units from 0 to 7. Each digit is multiplied by a power of  8 with the power depending on the digits position. 
                83 (octal) to decimal is:

                <br><br>(8 x 8^1) + (3 x 8^0)<br> 64 + 3 = 67 (decimal) <br><br>

                In base 16 with units from 0 to F. It contains the set of units {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
                6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F} with A = 10, B = 11, C = 12, and so forth. Like the 
                preceding systems, each digit is multiplied by 16 to the power of its position.
                5B (hexadecimal) to decimal is:

                <br><br>(5 x 16^1) + (11 x 16^0) = 91 (decimal)<br><br>

               This is in base 60. Although it may seem too large, we use base 60 for a time and angles.
               Since it was first used by the Babylonians, the actual digits are in their numerica systems shown in the figure.
               However, some calculators like wolframalpha notate their numbers like this:
                <br><br>
               1:59 (base 16) for 119 in decimal
	        with 1 and 59 each taking up one digit so	(1 x 60^1) + (59 x 60^0)
	        60 + 59 = 119 (decimal)
                <br><br>

            You can, however, arbitrarily choose different symbols for each unit, after all, 
            such symbols can be algebraically equated to numbers like how A = 10 and B = 11 in base 16.
            <br><br>Online calculators like math.tools use the number 1 - 9 for 1- 9 in decimal then A - Z for the 
            decimal numbers 10 - 35 (A = 10, B = 11, C = 12, ..., Z = 35) then small letters a - x for 36 - 59 (a = 36, b = 37, c = 38, ..., x = 59).
            So using the examples before, 119 in decimal can be converted to 1:59 in base 60 or using the symbols mentioned above, 1x in base 60.
